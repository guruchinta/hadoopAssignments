 
Group Assignment: ﻿Letter Count﻿
Due date: 3/20 by noon (12:00 PM)
Total points: 15pts (+5pts)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

﻿1. Write a MapReduce program to find the frequency of each letter, case insensitive, in user-specified input files. For example, "The quick brown﻿﻿﻿ fox jumps over the lazy dog" as input should generate the following output (letter,count) pairs: (T, 2), (H, 1), (E, 3), etc.
2. Test your program against the 3 attached input files.
3. The input and output will be read/written from/into HDFS.
4. Your program must consist of a single file, namely, LetterCount.java. Declare the mapper and reducer classes as inner classes.
5. Please submit only the Java file LetterCount.java on Blackboard.
6. You will have only a single attempt to submit your file. Make sure you attach your file before you click on the submit button. Email submissions won't be accepted.
7. I might ask each student to demonstrate their program for grading.
8. I've attached the WordCount.java file as an example. You might find it useful to get started.

Bonus (+5pts):
9. You get extra points if your program can also generate one extra key-value pair to show the total count of letters whose key is the string "total" and the value should be the total count. 

Demo Instructions:
1. You must demonstrate the exact code that was submitted onto BB.
2. You will be asked to run the necessary commands in a terminal to:
2.1. Upload the input files into HDFS. (starting HDFS if necessary)
2.2. Compile your code.
2.3. Package the compiled code into a jar file.
2.4. Run the job in Hadoop using YARN. (starting YARN if necessary)
2.5. List the output files in HDFS.
2.6. Display the output in the terminal window.
3. There might be some questions related to the code, and to the whole process.
